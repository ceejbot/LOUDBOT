# LOUDBOT-MASTODON

A LOUDBOT FOR MASTODON.

YOU WILL NEED TO DEPLOY THIS IN A DIRECTORY WHERE IT HAS WRITE PERMISSIONS BECAUSE IT WANTS TO LEARN FROM YOUR SHOUTING. IT WANTS TWO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SET, WHICH YOU CAN PUT IN `.env`:

* `MASTO_URL` - BASE URL OF YOUR MASTODON INSTANCE
* `MASTO_TOKEN` - API TOKEN FOR YOUR LOUDBOT USER

YOU CAN ALSO SET `STAR_FIGHTING` TO ANY NON-NULL VALUE IF YOU LIKE WARS OF THE STARS.

EVERYTHING LOUDBOT SHOUTS COMES FROM THE FILE `LOUDS` PLUS THE SEED FILE `STARTERS`. NEW SHOUTS ARE WRITTEN TO `INCOMING`. THEY WILL NOT BE SHOUTED BACK UNTIL YOU MOVE THEM TO `LOUDS`. THIS HAND CURATION PREVENTS JERKS FROM RUINING THE FUN.

YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN A [LOUDBOT FOR SLACK WRITTEN IN RUST](https://github.com/ceejbot/LOUDCRAB).
